# Your Workspace

This is YOUR space. Everything here persists across sessions.

## Your Tools

Create your own skills, agents, and commands here. They get merged with course tools every time you open the Codespace.

- **skills/** - Your custom skills (create folders with SKILL.md inside)
- **agents/** - Your custom agents (.md files)
- **commands/** - Your custom commands (.md files)

## Your Work

- **projects/** - Your analysis projects, apps, and outputs
- **notes/** - Personal notes, scratch work

## Course Materials

- **docs/** - Scenario documents (Meridian Industries)
- **data/** - CSV data files for analysis

## How It Works

1. You create a skill in `workspace/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`
2. Every time you open the Codespace, it gets copied into `.claude/skills/`
3. Claude sees both your tools AND course tools

## Tips

- Type `/help` to see all available commands
- Ask Claude "What skills are available?"
- Your work here is safe—it never gets deleted
