# Files & Folders

The sidebar on the left shows your files - like the file explorer on your computer (Finder on Mac, File Explorer on Windows).

## Opening the File Explorer

1. Click the **papers icon** at the top of the sidebar
2. Or press `Cmd+Shift+E` (Mac) / `Ctrl+Shift+E` (Windows)

## Your Folder Structure

Here's what you'll see in this course:

```
feedforward-ai-course/
├── docs/              ← Course documents and guides
│   ├── vscode/        ← VS Code help (you're reading this!)
│   └── claude-code/   ← Claude Code reference
├── data/              ← CSV files for analysis
├── practice/          ← Your active practice scenario
├── workspace/         ← Your personal work area
│   ├── projects/      ← Your analysis outputs
│   └── notes/         ← Scratch work
└── CLAUDE.md          ← Instructions for Claude
```

## Opening Files

| Action | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| **Single click** | Preview the file (temporary - italic tab name) |
| **Double click** | Open permanently (normal tab name) |

**Pro tip:** If you single-click several files, each new one replaces the preview. Double-click to keep a file open.

## Creating New Files

1. Right-click in the sidebar
2. Select "New File"
3. Type the filename (including extension like `.md` or `.txt`)
4. Press Enter

## Creating New Folders

1. Right-click in the sidebar
2. Select "New Folder"
3. Type the folder name
4. Press Enter

## Renaming Files

1. Right-click the file
2. Select "Rename"
3. Type the new name
4. Press Enter

Or: Click the file once, wait a second, click again (like renaming on your desktop).

## Deleting Files

1. Right-click the file
2. Select "Delete"
3. Confirm

**Warning:** This is permanent! (Well, it goes to your system trash, but still be careful.)

## Finding Files Quickly

Press `Cmd+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+P` (Windows) to open Quick Open:
1. Start typing the filename
2. Select from the list
3. Press Enter

This is faster than clicking through folders.

## Opening Files Side by Side

1. Open a file
2. Drag its tab to the right edge of the editor
3. Or: Right-click the tab → "Split Right"

Now you can see two files at once!

## Common Confusion

**"I can't find my file"**
- Use Quick Open: `Cmd+P` / `Ctrl+P`
- Check if you're in the right folder

**"The sidebar isn't showing"**
- Press `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` to toggle it

**"I accidentally deleted something"**
- Check your system trash/recycle bin
- Or ask Claude to help recreate it
