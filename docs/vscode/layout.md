# The VS Code Layout

This page explains what you're looking at when you open VS Code.

## The Four Main Areas

### 1. Menu Bar (Top)

The strip at the very top with File, Edit, View, etc.

- **File** - Open, save, close files
- **Edit** - Undo, redo, find, replace
- **View** - Show/hide different panels
- **Terminal** - Open a new terminal

You won't need this much - keyboard shortcuts are faster.

### 2. Sidebar (Left)

The vertical panel on the left side. It has different views:

| Icon | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| Papers (top) | **File Explorer** - Your folders and files |
| Magnifying glass | **Search** - Find text across files |
| Branches | **Source Control** - Git stuff (ignore for now) |
| Blocks | **Extensions** - Add-ons for VS Code |

**Can't see it?** Press `Cmd+B` (Mac) or `Ctrl+B` (Windows) to toggle.

### 3. Editor Area (Center)

The main area where you read and edit files.

- **Tabs** at the top show open files
- Click a tab to switch between files
- You can have multiple files open side-by-side

**Tab indicators:**
- *Italic name* = Preview mode (temporary)
- Normal name = Permanently open
- Dot before name = Unsaved changes

### 4. Terminal (Bottom)

The text-based area at the bottom where you type commands.

This is where you'll talk to Claude!

**Can't see it?** Press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick key, below Escape).

## Showing and Hiding Panels

| Panel | Toggle Shortcut |
|-------|-----------------|
| Sidebar | `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B` |
| Terminal | `` Ctrl+` `` |
| Full screen | `Cmd+Shift+F` / `F11` |

## Resizing Panels

You can drag the borders between panels to resize them:
- Drag the sidebar's right edge to make it wider/narrower
- Drag the terminal's top edge to make it taller/shorter

## Common Confusion

**"Everything disappeared!"**
- The sidebar might be hidden → Press `Cmd+B` / `Ctrl+B`
- The terminal might be hidden → Press `` Ctrl+` ``

**"I have too many tabs!"**
- Right-click a tab → "Close Others" or "Close All"
- Or just press `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W` to close the current tab

**"The screen looks different from the picture"**
- VS Code is customizable - your instructor may have set it up differently
- The core areas (sidebar, editor, terminal) are always the same
