## The Command Palette

Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) to open the **Command Palette**.

This is like a search bar for everything VS Code can do:
1. Press the shortcut
2. Type what you want to do (e.g., "preview markdown")
3. Select from the list
4. Press Enter

If you forget a shortcut, the Command Palette can find it for you!

## Tips for Learning Shortcuts

1. **Start with just 5** - The essentials above
2. **Use them repeatedly** - Muscle memory takes time
3. **Add one at a time** - When you notice doing something often, learn its shortcut
4. **Use the Command Palette** - It shows shortcuts next to commands
